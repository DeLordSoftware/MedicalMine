        -- e placed distraction over the C6�C7 level and again this level was quite degenerative - We used the Midas drill to drill into the disk space and curettes and pituitary rongeur to clean out the disk .
        -- e turned ouz attention to the plating portion of the operation at the C5� 7 level.
