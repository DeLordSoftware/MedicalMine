5) Category - Multi Level or Single Level:

    ++ level ++
        -- es, adj acent level disease, persistent neurologic deficit, and after understanding these risks, the patient consented for surgery.
        -- We placed lateral retractor blades underneath the first level of disk at C3�C4, then placed Caspar pins into thd body of C3 and C4 respectively under fluoroscopic guidance .
        -- nce we were satisfied with Chae level, we measured the interspace to fit a i 5 nun width by 12 mm depth graft with a 7 mm he�ght .
        -- At this level, there was a tear in the PLL with a disk herniation consistent with MRI finding.
        -- Then, we removed our C4 Caspar pin and turned to the next level of
        -- The Caspar pin was placed into the body of C 6 and distraction wasE placed over the CS�C6 disk level.
        -- At this level, this is more of a degenerative disk .
        -- There was a lot of bsteophytes at this level .
        -- At this level, we used a tricorticaL iliac crest graft, about 6 mm in height .
        -- e placed distraction over the C6�C7 level and again this level was quite degenerative - We used the Midas drill to drill into the disk space and curettes and pituitary rongeur to clean out the disk .
        -- e turned ouz attention to the plating portion of the operation at the C5� 7 level.

6) Category - Hardware Type:

    ++ Screws ++
        -- The plate was secured into position using 2 screws into the body of C5, 2 screws into the body of C6 and 2 screws into the body of Cl .

8) Category - Bone Growth Stimlator:

    ++ Bone ++
        -- ,DR ROI�C cage wa� filled with autograft bone as well as allograft bone chips and tamped into position under fluoroscopic guidance, then 2 shims were used to secure the cage into position.
        -- The cage was again filled with autograft and allograft bone and then tamped into position under fluoroscopic guidance.
        -- nce we were satisfied, we turned our attention to bone graft.

9) Category - Vertebrea Levels:

    ++ C3-C4 ++
        -- POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical radiculopathy with myelopathy; C3-C4, C4�C5t C5-C6, C6-7; cervical stenosis from disk herniation and disk oseeophyte complex.
    ++ C5-C6 ++
        -- POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical radiculopathy with myelopathy; C3-C4, C4�C5t C5-C6, C6-7; cervical stenosis from disk herniation and disk oseeophyte complex.
    ++ C6-C7 ++
        -- Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion with plate and instrumentation, C5�C6 and C6-C7 .

    ++ Hematoma ++
        -- 'I'his includes the rd-sk of general anesthesia, bleeding, infection, motor sensory deficit, paralysis, CSF leak, persistent pain, nonunion requiring reoperation, postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation, hoarseness, swallowing difficultd.
    ++ Neurologic ++
        -- es, adj acent level disease, persistent neurologic deficit, and after understanding these risks, the patient consented for surgery.
    ++ Infection ++
        -- 'I'his includes the rd-sk of general anesthesia, bleeding, infection, motor sensory deficit, paralysis, CSF leak, persistent pain, nonunion requiring reoperation, postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation, hoarseness, swallowing difficultd.
    ++ Bleeding ++
        -- 'I'his includes the rd-sk of general anesthesia, bleeding, infection, motor sensory deficit, paralysis, CSF leak, persistent pain, nonunion requiring reoperation, postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation, hoarseness, swallowing difficultd.
        -- We coagulated any muscle bleeding.
    ++ CSF leak ++
        -- 'I'his includes the rd-sk of general anesthesia, bleeding, infection, motor sensory deficit, paralysis, CSF leak, persistent pain, nonunion requiring reoperation, postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation, hoarseness, swallowing difficultd.

    ++ Allograft ++
        -- ,DR ROI�C cage wa� filled with autograft bone as well as allograft bone chips and tamped into position under fluoroscopic guidance, then 2 shims were used to secure the cage into position.
        -- The cage was again filled with autograft and allograft bone and then tamped into position under fluoroscopic guidance.
    ++ Autograft ++
